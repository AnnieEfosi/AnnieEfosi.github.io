I count myself lucky that over the last few years, I have slowly transitioned from working in an office full time to working from anywhere I want. Each time I experienced the shift towards remote working, it was prompted in response to a significant event. It doesn’t surprise me at all that companies who can are now quick to have their employees working from home. What worries is me is the lack of preparation across the board for something that is such a drastic change. I wish I had sought guidance on how things were going to change for me earlier. Whilst I don’t have all the answers, I want to make the transition easier for the ‘virgins’ at this game. If you have started working from home for the first time, this is for you.
